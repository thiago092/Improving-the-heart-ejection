abstract = {This chapter introduces the convolutional neural networks (CNNs, or ConvNets for short), deep neural networks with special image processing applications. These networks significantly improve the processing of information by providing several new concepts, and are still a great option in many problems involving continuously sampled data in a rectangular grid: audio signals (1D), images (2D), volumetric MRI data (3D), and more. A ConvNet is an old method developed in the 1980s and 1990s. It was relatively long forgotten because it was impractical in real applications of complex images. Since 2012 this method has received considerable attention again and has been used in most computer vision studies. Therefore, it has been evolving rapidly. After introducing the basics of convolutional networks, this chapter analyzes three applications of convolutional neural networks in bioinformatics, namely coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis, breast cancer predicting, and diabetic retinopathy detection.}

abstract = {Inspired by the success of transformer-based pre-training methods on natural language tasks and further computer vision tasks, researchers have started to apply transformer to video processing. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of transformer-based pre-training methods for Video-Language learning. We first briefly introduce the transformer structure as the background knowledge, including attention mechanism, position encoding etc. We then describe the typical paradigm of pre-training & fine-tuning on Video-Language processing in terms of proxy tasks, downstream tasks and commonly used video datasets. Next, we categorize transformer models into Single-Stream and Multi-Stream structures, highlight their innovations and compare their performances. Finally, we analyze and discuss the current challenges and possible future research directions for Video-Language pre-training.}

abstract="Right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) is an important indicator of cardiac function and has a well-established prognostic value. In scenarios where imaging modalities capable of directly assessing RVEF are unavailable, deep learning (DL) might be used to infer RVEF from alternative modalities, such as two-dimensional echocardiography. For the implementation of such solutions, publicly available, dedicated datasets are pivotal.",

abstract = {Transformers have dominated the field of natural language processing and have recently made an impact in the area of computer vision. In the field of medical image analysis, transformers have also been successfully used in to full-stack clinical applications, including image synthesis/reconstruction, registration, segmentation, detection, and diagnosis. This paper aimed to promote awareness of the applications of transformers in medical image analysis. Specifically, we first provided an overview of the core concepts of the attention mechanism built into transformers and other basic components. Second, we reviewed various transformer architectures tailored for medical image applications and discuss their limitations. Within this review, we investigated key challenges including the use of transformers in different learning paradigms, improving model efficiency, and coupling with other techniques. We hope this review would provide a comprehensive picture of transformers to readers with an interest in medical image analysis.}

abstract="Ultrasound tracking of organs or target volumes is a promising means to correct the displacement caused by respiration and errors from repositioning in medical applications e.g. in radiation therapy. However, one major problem of ultrasound images is their inherent low contrast and clutter which often makes standard algorithms instable for this purpose. In this work we present the adaption and application of a probabilistic tracking approach based on conditional density propagation (condensation) for real-time tracking on ultrasound images. This approach promises to facilitate robust real-time tracking with 5 degrees of freedom (translation and scaling in x-/y- direction, rotation) of anatomic structures on noisy and low contrast ultrasound images. The real-time performance and precision of the algorithm are investigated with ultrasound data from the liver. The tracking results of the algorithm are compared with results obtained from image registration. It is shown that this algorithm is real-time capable with processing time less than 5 ms per frame and robust on low contrast target structures with a precision below 1.6 mm in translation. Compared with an independent image co-registration method, this method leads to a superior displacement correction in pre-delinated target structures.",
